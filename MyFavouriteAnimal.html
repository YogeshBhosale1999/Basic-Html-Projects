<h2>A General Introduction</h2>
<p>
The <em>dog </em>(Canis familiaris when considered a distinct species or Canis lupus familiaris when 
considered a subspecies of the wolf) is a domesticated carnivore of the family Canidae. 
It is part of the wolf-like canids,and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore.
The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are not 
closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated,which implies that the 
direct ancestor of the dog is extinct.The dog was the first species to be domesticated,
and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical 
attributes.
</p>
<p>
Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior and they 
are able to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.Dogs vary widely 
in shape, size and colors.They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, 
protection, assisting police and military, companionship and, more recently, aiding disabled people and therapeutic roles.
This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend".

<h2>What famous people have quoted about them.....</h2>
<blockquote>
“If you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous he will not bite you. This is the principal difference between a dog and man.”
 -Mark Twain

<blockquote>
“Dogs never bite me. Just humans.”
― Marilyn Monroe

<blockquote>
“Owners of dogs will have noticed that, if you provide them with food and water and shelter and affection, they will think you are god. 
Whereas owners of cats are compelled to realize that, if you provide them with food and water and shelter and affection, they draw the 
conclusion that they are gods.”
― Christopher Hitchens

<h2>The Origin of Dogs</h2>
<p>
The origin of the domestic dog includes the dog's genetic divergence from the wolf, its domestication, and its development into dog types
 and dog breeds. The dog is a member of the genus Canis, which forms part of the wolf-like canids, and was the first species and the only 
 large carnivore to have been domesticated.Genetic studies comparing dogs with modern wolves show reciprocal monophyly (separate groups), 
 which implies that dogs are not genetically close to any living wolf and that their wild ancestor is extinct.An extinct Late Pleistocene 
 wolf may have been the ancestor of the dog,with the dog's similarity to the extant grey wolf being the result of genetic admixture between
 the two.In 2020, a literature review of canid domestication stated that modern dogs were not descended from the same Canis lineage as
 modern wolves, and proposes that dogs may be descended from a Pleistocene wolf closer in size to a village dog.

<p>
The genetic divergence between dogs and wolves occurred between 20,000 and 40,000 years ago, just before or during the Last Glacial Maximum(20,000-27,000 years ago).
 This timespan represents the upper time-limit for the commencement of domestication because it is the timeof divergence and not the time of domestication,
 which occurred later.One of the most important transitions in human history was the domestication of animals, which began with the long-term association
 between wolves and hunter–gatherers more than 15,000 years ago. The archaeological record and genetic analysis show the remains of the Bonn–Oberkassel dog 
 buried beside humans 14,200 years ago to be the first undisputed dog, with disputed remains occurring 36,000 years ago.

<h2>Biology</h2>

<h3>Skull of a dog</h3>
Domestic dogs have been selectively bred for millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.Modern dog breeds show more 
variation in size, appearance, and behavior than any other domestic animal.Dogs are predators and scavengers; like many other predatory mammals, 
the dog has powerful muscles, large and sharp claws and teeth, fused wrist bones, a cardiovascular system that supports both sprinting and endurance,
 and teeth for catching and tearing.

<h3>Size and weight</h3>
Dogs are highly variable in height and weight. The smallest known adult dog was a Yorkshire Terrier, that stood only 6.3 centimetres (2 1⁄2 inches)
 at the shoulder, 9.5 cm (3 3⁄4 in) in length along the head-and-body, and weighed only 113 grams (4 ounces). The largest known dog was a Saint Bernard 
 which weighed 167.6 kg (369 1⁄2 lb) and was 250 cm (8 ft 2 in) from the snout to the tail.The tallest dog is a Great Dane that stands 106.7 cm (3 ft 6 in) at the shoulder.

<h3>Senses</h3>
Further information: Dog anatomy § Senses
The dog's senses include vision, hearing, sense of smell, sense of taste, touch and sensitivity to the earth's magnetic field. Another study suggested that dogs can see the 
earth's magnetic field.

<h3>Coat</h3>
Dogs display a wide variation on coat type, density, length, color, and composition
The coats of domestic dogs are of two varieties: "double" being common with dogs (as well as wolves)
 originating from colder climates, made up of a coarse guard hair and a soft down hair, or "single", 
 with the topcoat only. Breeds may have an occasional "blaze", stripe, or "star" of white fur on their chest or underside.
Regarding coat appearance or health, the coat can be maintained or affected by multiple nutrients present in the diet, see Coat (dog) for more information.
Premature graying can occur in dogs from as early as one year of age. This has been shown to be associated with impulsive behaviors, anxiety behaviors, fear of noise,
and fear of unfamiliar people or animals.

<h3>Tail</h3>
There are many different shapes for dog tails: straight, straight up, sickle, curled, or cork-screw. As with many canids, one of the primary functions 
of a dog's tail is to communicate their emotional state, which can be important in getting along with others. In some hunting dogs, however, the tail is
 traditionally docked to avoid injuries.In some breeds, such as the Braque du Bourbonnais, puppies can be born with a short tail or no tail at all.

<h3>Differences from wolves</h3>
Despite their close genetic relationship and the ability to inter-breed, there are a number of diagnostic features to distinguish the gray wolves from domestic dogs.
 Domesticated dogs are clearly distinguishable from wolves by starch gel electrophoresis of red blood cell acid phosphatase.The tympanic bullae are large, convex 
 and almost spherical in gray wolves, while the bullae of dogs are smaller, compressed and slightly crumpled.Compared with equally sized wolves, dogs tend to have 
 20% smaller skulls and 30% smaller brains.The teeth of gray wolves are also proportionately larger than those of dogs.Dogs have a more domed forehead and 
 a distinctive "stop" between forehead and nose.The temporalis muscle that closes the jaws is more robust in wolves.Wolves do not have dewclaws on their 
 back legs, unless there has been admixture with dogs that had them.Most dogs lack a functioning pre-caudal gland and enter estrus twice yearly, unlike gray wolves 
 which only do so once a year.So-called primitive dogs such as dingoes and Basenjis retain the yearly estrus cycle.
Dogs generally have brown eyes and wolves almost always have amber or light colored eyes.The skin of domestic dogs tends to be thicker than that of wolves,
 with some Inuit tribes favoring the former for use as clothing due to its greater resistance to wear and tear in harsh weather. The paws of a dog are half
 the size of those of a wolf, and their tails tend to curl upwards, another trait not found in wolves.The dog has developed into hundreds of varied breeds, 
 and shows more behavioral and morphological variation than any other land mammal.

<h3>Health</h3>
There are many household plants that are poisonous to dogs (and other mammals) including Begonia, Poinsettia and Aloe vera.
Some breeds of dogs are prone to certain genetic ailments such as elbow and hip dysplasia, blindness, deafness, pulmonic stenosis, 
cleft palate, and trick knees. Two serious medical conditions particularly affecting dogs are pyometra, affecting unspayed females of 
all types and ages, and gastric dilatation volvulus (bloat), which affects the larger breeds or deep-chested dogs. Both of these are acute conditions, 
and can kill rapidly. Dogs are also susceptible to parasites such as fleas, ticks, mites, hookworms, tapeworms, roundworms, and heartworms 
(roundworm species that lives in the heart of dogs).A number of common human foods and household ingestibles are toxic to dogs, including chocolate solids
 (theobromine poisoning), onion and garlic (thiosulphate, sulfoxide or disulfide poisoning),grapes and raisins, macadamia nuts, xylitol,as well as 
 various plants and other potentially ingested materials.The nicotine in tobacco can also be dangerous. Dogs can be exposed to the substance by scavenging 
 through garbage bins or ashtrays and eating cigars and cigarettes. Signs can be vomiting of large amounts (e.g., from eating cigar butts) or diarrhea.
 Some other signs are abdominal pain, loss of coordination, collapse, or death.Dogs are susceptible to theobromine poisoning, typically from ingestion
 of chocolate. Theobromine is toxic to dogs because, although the dog's metabolism is capable of breaking down the chemical, the process is so slow that 
 for some dogs even small amounts of chocolate can be fatal, especially dark chocolate.Dogs are also vulnerable to some of the same health conditions as humans, 
 including diabetes, dental and heart disease, epilepsy, cancer, hypothyroidism, and arthritis.

<h3>Lifespan</h3>
Mixed-breed dogs such as this terrier have been found to run faster and live longer than their pure-bred parents (see Heterosis).
In 2013, a study found that mixed breeds live on average 1.2 years longer than pure breeds, and that increasing body-weight was negatively 
correlated with longevity (i.e. the heavier the dog the shorter its lifespan).The typical lifespan of dogs varies widely among breeds,
 but for most the median longevity, the age at which half the dogs in a population have died and half are still alive, ranges from 10 to 13 years.
Individual dogs may live well beyond the median of their breed.The breed with the shortest lifespan (among breeds for which there is a questionnaire 
survey with a reasonable sample size) is the Dogue de Bordeaux, with a median longevity of about 5.2 years, but several breeds, including miniature bull 
terriers, bloodhounds, and Irish wolfhounds are nearly as short-lived, with median longevities of 6 to 7 years.The longest-lived breeds, including 
toy poodles, Japanese spitz, Border terriers, and Tibetan spaniels, have median longevities of 14 to 15 years.The median longevity of mixed-breed dogs, 
taken as an average of all sizes, is one or more years longer than that of purebred dogs when all breeds are averaged.The longest-lived dog 
was "Bluey", an Australian Cattle Dog who died in 1939 at 29.5 years of age.

<h3>Reproduction</h3>
In domestic dogs, sexual maturity happens around six to twelve months of age for both males and females,
although this can be delayed until up to two years old for some large breeds. This is the time at which female dogs will have their first 
estrous cycle. They will experience subsequent estrous cycles semiannually, during which the body prepares for pregnancy. At the peak of the cycle, 
females will come into estrus, being mentally and physically receptive to copulation.Because the ova survive and are capable of being fertilized 
for a week after ovulation, it is possible for more than one male to sire the same litter.Fertilization typically occurs 2–5 days after ovulation; 
14–16 days after ovulation, the embryo attaches to the uterus, and after 7-8 more days the heart beat is detectable.Dogs bear their litters roughly 
58 to 68 days after fertilization,with an average of 63 days, although the length of gestation can vary. An average litter consists of about six puppies,
though this number may vary widely based on the breed of dog. In general, toy dogs produce from one to four puppies in each litter, while much larger breeds 
may average as many as twelve.Some dog breeds have acquired traits through selective breeding that interfere with reproduction. Male French Bulldogs, 
for instance, are incapable of mounting the female. For many dogs of this breed, the female must be artificially inseminated in order to reproduce.

<h3>Neutering</h3>
Neutering refers to the sterilization of animals, usually by removal of the male's testicles or the female's ovaries and uterus, in order to eliminate the ability
 to procreate and reduce sex drive. Because of the overpopulation of dogs in some countries, many animal control agencies, such as the American Society for the
 Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), advise that dogs not intended for further breeding should be neutered, so that they do not have undesired puppies that
 may later be euthanized.According to the Humane Society of the United States, 3–4 million dogs and cats are euthanized each year in the United States and 
 many more are confined to cages in shelters because there are many more animals than there are homes. Spaying or castrating dogs helps keep overpopulation down.Local
 humane societies, SPCAs, and other animal protection organizations urge people to neuter their pets and to adopt animals from shelters instead of purchasing them.
Neutering reduces problems caused by hypersexuality, especially in male dogs.Spayed female dogs are less likely to develop some forms of cancer, affecting mammary glands, 
ovaries, and other reproductive organs.However, neutering increases the risk of urinary incontinence in female dogs,and prostate cancer in males,as well as osteosarcoma, 
hemangiosarcoma, cruciate ligament rupture, obesity, and diabetes mellitus in either sex.

<h3>Inbreeding depression</h3>
A common breeding practice for pet dogs is mating between close relatives (e.g. between half- and full siblings).Inbreeding depression is considered to be due largely to
 the expression of homozygous deleterious recessive mutations.Outcrossing between unrelated individuals, including dogs of different breeds, results in the beneficial
 masking of deleterious recessive mutations in progeny.In a study of seven breeds of dogs (Bernese mountain dog, basset hound, Cairn terrier, Epagneul Breton, German
 Shepherd dog, Leonberger, and West Highland white terrier) it was found that inbreeding decreases litter size and survival.Another analysis of data on 42,855 
 dachshund litters found that as the inbreeding coefficient increased, litter size decreased and the percentage of stillborn puppies increased, thus indicating inbreeding 
 depression.In a study of boxer litters, 22% of puppies died before reaching 7 weeks of age.Stillbirth was the most frequent cause of death, followed by infection. 
 Mortality due to infection increased significantly with increases in inbreeding.
